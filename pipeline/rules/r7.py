"""R7 — worker under a suspended load (v3).

Struck-by from a dropped load is one of construction's fatal four. The detector finds the
crane hook or the load hanging from it; the drop zone is everything directly beneath it.
A hanging load has no ground contact to calibrate from, so the test is in image space and
deliberately generous: a worker whose box overlaps the load's horizontal extent (widened
by `SIDE_MARGIN` either side, since loads swing) and who stands below it in the frame,
within `MAX_DROP_HEIGHTS` load heights. Heuristic by design; the evidence grade and the
review loop catch the cases perspective gets wrong.

A detection only counts as a load if it looks like one: it hangs below its cable, so it is
not cut off by the top of the frame, and it is compact, not a tall column. On SARD 9 the
open-vocabulary detector labels the tower-crane mast "suspended load" in every frame;
these two checks reject it without touching real loads.
